//:Hello!ðŸ‘‹
//:
//:Today I will tell you a story about magic. In my opinion, magic is more than sleight of
//:hand, misdirection and showmanship. Magic is emotion and connects people in a strong way.
//:
//: **Card Magic**
//:The precise origins of card magic are subject to debate though it's generally believed that
//:card tricks were first developed by gamblers who wanted to improve their chances of winning when
//:playing card games.
//:My *goal* is to show you the most common plots in card magic.
//:Let's do some magic!

//: **Goal:** Snap your fingers to make a playing card materialize.
