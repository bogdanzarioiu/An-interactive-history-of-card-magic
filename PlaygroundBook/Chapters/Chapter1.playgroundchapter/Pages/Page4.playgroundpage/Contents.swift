//:Here I want to introduce you the concept of misdirection and talk a bit about some studies that were foccused on
//:this concept.
//:For example, in one study, a magician threw a ball into the air a few times. On the third throw, however, he
//:only pretended to throw it. Two thirds of the participants reported seeing the ball vanish in mid-air, even though it
//:never left his hand. The participants saw something amazing — something that never actually happened.

//: *“The principle of misdirection plays such an important role in magic that one might say that magic is misdirection
//:and misdirection is magic” - Hugard J. (1960). Misdirection.*
//:
//:Even though the misdirection techniques are heavily debated amongst magicians, most would agree
//:that social cues (i.e., where the magician looks) play a fundamental role in misdirection.
//:Magicians can manipulate people to an extraordinary degree because our subjective impression
//:of the world does not necessarily match reality.
