/*:
 # Mixing magic and technology
 */

//:  Now, let’s talk a bit about the near future. I really do believe that the technology can expand the
//:ways in which magic is performed and experienced. I’m sure you heard this many times before, but the possibilities are truly endless.
//:We will do a small experiment. Place yourself in the shoes of a spectator.
//:Imagine being able to freely select a playing card. It’s just in your mind, only you know its value.
//:The magician shows you his phone and opens the phone’s camera. He wants you to record him since he's about to do
//:something cool.
//:Suddenly, from nowhere, you see a playing card you were just thinking of appearing and moving into the real world.
//:
//:It’s a very simple concept and it can have many twists, but the idea behind this is to let your imagination fly, 
//:to leave you with something to think about.
//:
//:***Thank you!***
