 ** Card Magic**
 The precise origins of card magic are subject to debate though it's generally believed that card tricks were first developed by gamblers who wanted to improve their chances of winning when playing card games.
 Our *goal* is to discover together this new world!
 
 Let's do some magic!
 Snap your fingers to make a playing card materialize.
